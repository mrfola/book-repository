# Book Repository

This is a web application built in React.js that allows users to find books they are interested in and save it to their own personal curated list so they can access it later.

The live project can be seen here: [Book Repository](https://book-repository.netlify.app/)

## Concept

The idea behind this project is to build a platform that makes it easy for book-lovers to find, save and keep track of all their books in a simple and flexible manner.. 

The idea is to help users to keep track of all their books (the ones they've read, they are currently reading or the ones they wish to read), organize it (according to lists, tags and categories) and even share their reading list with other people to encourage them to read likewise. 

It is useful for students, professors, researchers or just book enthusiasts. 

The project is still in it's initial stages but many new additions are in the works and will be added over the next few months. Some of those change are listed [here](#future-features). 

## Technology

The project is currently a frontend-only application built with Javascript (React.Js), hence the data isn't persistent yet. 

It uses LocalStorage to hold data for now. 

Upcoming changes will involve connecting the frontend to some sort of backend platform like firebase or maybe an API built in Laravel or Django. 

Book Repository currently gets all the book information from the [Google Books API]() (which is an API built by Google  that allows your application to perform full-text searches and retrieve book information, viewability, and eBook availability) 

## Future Features

* Connect to a more book APIs in order to get a wider range of books for users
* Ability for users to save books in several lists
* Ability to read books directly from the platform without having to download
* Ability for users to share their current reading list with their friends (their friends will be able to see several information such as: their current page count, the date they started the book, the number of pages read per day, etc)
* Reading Challenges: Users will be able to create reading challenges (with prizes for the winners, if they want) that will be managed and tracked from the app. The creator of a reading challenge is called a challenge master.  The reading challenges can have : 
  * Daily targets
  * Weekly targets
  * Monthly targets
  * Point allocation system based on whether a user hits the required target or not. 
  * Ability to determine winner based on criteria set by the challenge master as well as the points amassed by each user.
  * Reading with project: Some type of reading is best done with a project alongside (reading a technical book for instance) and the platform will allow users to submit their projects every day, week or month (based on the challenge master) and it will allocate points accordingly.
* And many more features.
